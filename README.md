# üìä Portfolio Optimisation Project (TCNJ ‚Äì Extended Version)

This Python program calculates and visualises the **Efficient Frontier** for a two-stock portfolio and runs a **Monte Carlo simulation** to project future portfolio performance.  
It was developed as part of coursework at **The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)** and demonstrates key principles of **Modern Portfolio Theory**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Calculates:
  - Expected returns
  - Risk (standard deviation)
  - Correlation
  - Sharpe ratio
- Builds and plots the **Efficient Frontier**
- Identifies:
  - **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)**
  - **Optimal Portfolio** (highest Sharpe ratio)
- Runs a **Monte Carlo simulation** of future portfolio growth
